Sorry it took so long to respond. I got accepted to participate in this thing called NCAS. NCAS is a NASA program that selects a few STEM students from community colleges and has them take an online course. If you score high enough on the course, you can then be invited to a NASA campus to work on a project for a week. If you do well on that project, you can get offered a NASA internship. It has been dope to be a part of, but it is definitely kicking my ass a little bit.

I'm saying all of this not to brag, but to explain that I heard about this program (and was pushed to apply) from being a part of LSAMP. Even though it is too late to qualify for the cash stipend this semester, the organization exposes you to all types of people and events in the STEM field. I was told to take the application link down from that website (hcclsamp.org), but here is the application link. If you don't hear anything back by next week, simply email me and I will make sure the director brings you aboard. hccs.edu/lsamp

Finally, the cool thing about the STEM field is that there are a million ways to reach the same desired path (assuming that that path is a tech career and M's in your bank account). There is a lot to explain, but it all kind of depends on your interest. Shoot me a text with a good availability time for you this week and I'll schedule a call so we can chop it up.
